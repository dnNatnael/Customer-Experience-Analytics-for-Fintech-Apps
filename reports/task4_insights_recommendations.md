## 5. Ethics & Bias Reflection

### 5.1 Negative Review Bias

Google Play Store reviews are inherently biased toward negative feedback. Research shows that users are **2-3 times more likely** to leave reviews when they experience problems than when they have positive experiences. This creates a natural overrepresentation of complaints in the dataset.

**Impact on Analysis:**
- Pain points may appear more severe than they actually are
- Satisfaction drivers may be underrepresented
- The silent majority of satisfied users may not be reflected in the data

**Mitigation:**
- Consider that actual user satisfaction may be higher than review data suggests
- Focus on relative comparisons between banks rather than absolute numbers
- Validate findings through additional research methods

### 5.2 App Version and Update Cycles

Reviews may reflect experiences with different app versions, as users update their apps at different rates. A review complaining about a bug that has already been fixed in a newer version could mislead analysis.

**Specific Concerns:**
- **CBE:** Multiple reviews mention issues with "recent updates" breaking features
- **BOA:** Users complain about problems introduced with "new updates"
- **Dashen:** Some reviews reference outdated versions

**Impact:**
- Reviews may not reflect current app state
- Historical issues may be overrepresented
- Direct comparisons between banks may be affected by different update frequencies

**Mitigation:**
- Consider review dates when available (though limited in this dataset)
- Focus on recurring themes rather than isolated complaints
- Acknowledge that some issues may have been addressed in recent updates

### 5.3 Sample Demographics

The dataset may not represent all user segments equally. Users who leave reviews may differ from the general user base in several ways:

**Potential Biases:**
- **Technical Proficiency:** Tech-savvy users may be overrepresented
- **Age:** Younger users may be more likely to leave reviews
- **Engagement Level:** Highly engaged (both positive and negative) users are more likely to review
- **Language:** Reviews are primarily in English, potentially missing non-English speakers
- **Location:** Users in certain regions may be over/underrepresented

**Impact:**
- Findings may not generalize to all user segments
- Certain demographics' experiences may be underrepresented
- Language bias may miss important feedback from local language speakers

### 5.4 Limitations of Google Play Reviews Alone

Relying solely on Google Play Store reviews has several inherent limitations:

**1. Language Bias**
- Reviews are primarily in English
- May miss feedback from users who prefer Amharic or other local languages
- Cultural nuances in feedback may be lost in translation

**2. Selection Bias**
- Only users who actively choose to leave reviews are represented
- The "silent majority" of users may have different experiences
- Users with extreme opinions (very positive or very negative) are overrepresented

**3. Temporal Bias**
- Recent reviews may be overrepresented
- Older reviews may reflect outdated app versions
- Seasonal or event-driven review spikes may skew data

**4. Context Missing**
- Reviews lack context about:
  - User's device type and specifications
  - Network conditions at time of experience
  - Specific use cases or scenarios
  - User's technical background
  - Previous experience with banking apps

**5. Volume Limitations**
- With ~300-330 reviews per bank, statistical significance is limited
- Small sample sizes may not capture all user segments
- Rare but critical issues may be underrepresented

**6. Platform-Specific Issues**
- Android-specific issues may be overrepresented
- iOS users' experiences are not captured
- Platform-specific bugs may skew findings

### 5.5 Recommendations for Future Research

To address these limitations, consider:

1. **User Surveys:** Conduct structured surveys with representative samples
2. **Usability Testing:** Direct observation of users interacting with apps
3. **Analytics Data:** App usage metrics, crash reports, and performance data
4. **Customer Support Logs:** Analysis of support tickets and complaints
5. **Focus Groups:** Qualitative research with diverse user segments
6. **A/B Testing:** Controlled experiments for new features
7. **Multi-language Analysis:** Include reviews in local languages
8. **Longitudinal Studies:** Track user satisfaction over time
